INDUSTRIAL & COMMERCIAL TRANSPORTATION /// TERMINALS AND CONNECTORS
Introduction to Connectors
In heavy industries, electrical systems must stand up to rigorous conditions and all weather environments. 
Failure in an electrical system can be expensive to diagnose and down equipment can stop entire operations. 
As equipment becomes increasingly sophisticated and reliant on electronic packaging and diagnostics, design 
engineers know the importance of choosing environmentally sealed electrical connectors capable of holding up 
to extreme conditions. Many manufacturers count on TE Connectivity Industrial & Commercial Transportation’s 
electrical connectors to maintain their electrical connections. 
 
Benefits of industrial connectors 
There are many different connectors for harsh environments and connector selection for each specific appli-
cation is important. Once the questions of wire gauge and pin count have been addressed, the environmental 
challenges specific to each application must be identified, including if the electrical system will be exposed to 
heat, impact or vibration. Other elements that need to be addressed include if the connectors will be suscep-
tible to moisture or chemicals and field serviceability. Developed with simplicity of design and ease of use in 
mind, TE connectors offer a variety of innovative solutions to suit nearly any application and stand up to envi-
ronmental challenges.
Whether for a new application or a retrofit, connectors provide simplified design and wiring, and easy field 
repairs. TE Industrial & Commercial Transportation’s connector applications include ECUs, joysticks, industrial 
and marine engines, control boxes, lights and CAN systems, just to mention a few. TE Industrial & Commercial 
Transportation’s connector series offer several features designed to combat environmental challenges. 
Connector features help protect electrical connections 
Connector bodies must be able to stand up to environmental conditions. Rugged all-metal bodies and 
corrosion resistant thermoplastic shells are manufactured from high quality materials selected for their ability 
to withstand years of environmental exposure. Metal connectors are built to withstand the force and shock of 
hard impacts that connectors face in rough environments. High-grade thermoplastic connectors are lightweight 
and are engineered to be flame resistant and extremely chemical resistant. Different connector body materials 
are available to meet diverse application requirements. 
PAGE 5
Introduction to Connectors
Proper contact alignment is another important aspect 
of environmentally sealed electrical connectors. Sec-
ondary locks snap into or onto the mating face of a 
connector to help confirm the contacts slide together 
properly when the connectors are mated. Many of TE 
Industrial & Commercial Transportation’s connectors 
feature secondary locks that are commonly referred 
to as wedgelocks, terminal position assurance (TPA), 
or primary latch reinforcement (PLR). Wedgelocks, 
TPAs, and PLRs provide additional stability to both 
the contact barrel and the mated connectors. 
A firm, secure locking mechanism that can withstand 
vibration and shock is critical to maintain a steadfast 
connector engagement in rugged applications. TE Industrial & Commercial Transportation’s connectors are held 
together by push-latches, threaded coupling rings, or tightened together by jackscrews. The locking mecha-
nisms are easy to engage and disengage and give an audible or tactile signal when they are securely fastened. 
Once fastened, the locking mechanisms prevent disengagement due to vibration or impact. 
 
Since even a small degradation in electrical connections can be critical to industrial vehicles, manufacturers are 
turning to TE Industrial & Commercial Transportation’s environmentally sealed electrical connectors to keep 
their equipment running. Connectors are increasingly needed as industrial equipment becomes more complex 
and reliant on electronic control units, CAN systems, and on-board communications systems. With a wide vari-
ety of industrial electrical connectors, manufacturers can find a connector for nearly any application. No matter 
the environment, TE’s industrial connectors provide the innovative solutions demanded by harsh conditions. 
TE’s dedication to quality and innovation has created a unique system of easy-to-use connectors to simplify 
processes from start to finish.

CONTACT INSERTION
How To Instructions
Step 1:
Grasp crimped contact 
approximately one inch 
behind the contact barrel.
Step 2: 
Check that the wedgelock 
of the plug assembly is in 
open position. Align the 
contact with the 
applicable cavity.
Step 3:
Insert the contact into 
the connector cavity until 
there is an audible and 
tactile click. A slight tug 
will verify the contact is 
locked in place.
Step 4:
After all the contacts have 
been inserted, close the 
wedgelock by simultane-
ously squeezing locking 
latches inward and push-
ing the wedgelock into the 
housing.
Note
AMPSEAL connector grommet 
is solid until pierced.

CONTACT REMOVAL
Step 1:
Insert the tip of a screw-
driver (2-5mm wide blade) 
between the edge of the 
plug assembly housing 
and one corner of the 
wedgelock.
Step 2:
Gently pry the edge of 
the wedgelock until it is 
released from (but not 
completely removed) the 
housing. Repeat these 
steps for the opposite cor-
ner of the wedge.
Step 3:
Gently pull the wire of the 
contact to be removed 
while rotating the wire (a 
quarter turn each direc-
tion) back and forth until 
the contact is removed 
from the housing.

AMPSEAL 16 Hybrid Lever Overview
The AMPSEAL 16 hybrid lever is a sealed connector system 
that features a lever slide mechanism for mating and a slide in 
mounting clip. The mix of 24 size 16 and 4 size 12 terminals creates 
design flexibility for use in various vehicle applications. 
The tool-less mounting design, environmental protection, and 
temporary panel retention latches (which temporarily hold 
the connector in place for one person mounting through the 
panel) all reduce application cost and assembly time.

How To Instructions
CONTACT INSERTION
Step 1:
Hold connector with 
rear grommet/wire rout-
er cap facing you.
Step 2:
Push contact straight into 
contact cavity until a click 
is heard/felt. A slight tug 
will confirm the contact 
is inserted correctly.
Step 3:
Once all contacts are 
in place, insert wedge-
lock by lining up the 
keyway. The wedgelock 
will press into place.

ASSEMBLY
Improper assembly can cause the 
jackscrew to be stripped during 
assembly. To prevent damage, 
the jackscrew will strip out be-
fore the threads in the connector 
are damaged. If the jackscrew 
becomes stripped, please replace 
the jackscrew and the push nut.
Step 1:
Wedgelocks should be 
pressed firmly in place, 
with only a slight gap 
showing between the 
wedgelock and connector.
Step 2:
If the wedgelock will not 
go all the way in, check to 
make sure all of the con-
tacts are properly seated.
Step 3:
Contacts should be fully 
inserted into the con-
nector, with the locking 
fingers in place under 
the shoulder of the con-
tact. If a contact is not 
fully inserted, the reten-
tion finger will prevent 
the wedgelock from 
pressing into place. 
Step 4:
When mating the plug with 
the receptacle, confirm that 
the plug is not being pulled 
into the receptacle at an 
angle by the jackscrew.
Note
Do not over torque jackscrew. 
The recommended torque  
rating for the DRB series plug 
jackscrew when tightening is 
30-35 IN-LB (3.38-3.95 N.M.). 
CONTACT REMOVAL
Step 1:
Remove wedgelock using 
a screwdriver. Pull wed-
gelock straight out.
Step 2:
To remove contacts, gently 
pull wire backwards, while 
at the same time releas-
ing the locking finger by 
moving it away from the 
contact with a screwdriver.

DT Family Overview
DEUTSCH DT, DTM, and DTP series environmentally sealed connectors 
are designed for cable to cable and cable to board applications. The DT 
connectors are used in harsh environment applications where even a 
small degradation in connection may be critical. Thermoplastic housings 
offer a wide operating temperature range and silicone rear wire and 
interface seals allow the connectors to withstand conditions of extreme 
temperature and moisture.  
 
The DEUTSCH DT series general purpose connectors will provide 
reliability and performance on the engine or transmission, under the 
hood, on the chassis, or in the cab.
DT SERIES OVERVIEW
DEUTSCH DT series connectors offer field proven 
reliability and rugged quality. The DT design 
strengths include optional flange mounting, 
multi-pin arrangements, and design flexibility. 
The DT series offers the designer the ability to 
use multiple size 16 contacts, each with 13 amp 
continuous capacity, within a single shell.
DTP SERIES OVERVIEW
DEUTSCH DTP series connectors provide solutions 
for your power application requirements. Building 
on both the DT and DTM design strengths, the 
DTP connector line was developed to fill the need 
for higher amperage, multi-pin connectors. 
The DTP series offers the designer the ability 
to use multiple size 12 contacts, each with 25 
amp continuous capacity, within a single shell. 
The DTP connectors are currently available 
in two and four pin configurations.
DTM SERIES OVERVIEW
DEUTSCH DTM series connectors offer solutions to 
your smaller wire gauge applications. Building on 
the DT design strengths, the DTM connector line was 
developed to fill the need for lower amperage, multi-
pin connectors. The DTM series offers the designer 
the ability to use multiple size 20 contacts, each with 
7.5 amp continuous capacity, within a single shell.

Required Components
SECONDARY WEDGELOCKS
DEUTSCH DT style electrical connectors require secondary wedgelocks which are sold separately. The wedgelocks 
help confirm proper contact alignment within each connector. Secondary wedgelocks are assembled at the 
mating interface and press into place. If by chance the secondary wedgelocks are not properly seated during 
assembly, they will be pressed into locked position during the mating of the connector.
Adding to the design flexibility of the DT series, several wedgelocks offer keying options. Wedgelocks for 
enhanced seal retention plugs (P012) are also available.

Special Modifications
The DT series connectors offer several modifications to enhance the design flexibility and meet application 
specific needs. Options include enhanced seal retention, flanges, and connector body color just to mention a few. 
By combining the DT series connectors with the available modifications and accessories, the design possibilities 
are immense.
B016 MODIFICATION 
 
The B016 receptacle modification helps prevent mis-mating. The B016 
is available for the DT 12 way connectors, DT13/15, and DTF13/15 PCB 
series connectors. In addition to the four keying positions (A, B, C, or 
D) and color coding, the B016 enhancement gives the user both visual 
and tactile proof of correct mating, thus helping eliminate mis-mating 
opportunities during assembly.  
Please note the P012 plug is the required mate for the B016 receptacle to 
make the enhancement effective.

The E003 modification offers a protective end cap attached to the rear of the connector. 
There are holes in the cap to allow the contacts to be inserted.
C015 MODIFICATION 
 
The C015 modification offers a reduced diameter insert cavity allowing for a proper seal 
with smaller wire insulation. The C015 modification is also referred to as an “E” seal. 
P012 MODIFICATION 
 
The DT P012 plugs provide enhanced front seal 
retention resulting in an ultra tight environmental 
seal. The enhanced seal retention keeps the seal 
in place during mating and unmating. The P012 
modification requires an enhanced P012 wedgelock. 
The DEUTSCH P012 modification is available in 2, 3, 
4, 6, 8, and 12 cavity arrangements. P012 plugs have a 
black connector body except for the 8 and 12 cavity 
arrangements, where the color is based on the key.
DETECTOR 
 
The Detector connector has an integrated LED used for diagnostics. 
The transparent housing features reduced diameter seals and may 
be ordered with or without an end cap. Color coded wedgelocks 
for operating voltages, 12VDC and 24VDC are available.

GASKETS
Moisture, dirt, salt, sand, and road debris can all work their way into electrical panels through 
unsealed mounting flanges. Rated to operate in environments from -70°F to +225°F (-56°C to 
+107°C), these rugged high quality neoprene gaskets form a tight seal between the panel face 
and connector flange to help keep out destructive elements. The gaskets have a thickness of .125” 
and the material meets the UL-94-HBF, Mil-R-6130C, and FMVSS-302 flammability specifications.
DUST CAPS
The DT series dust caps are made of either thermoplastic or durable plastisol and are designed 
to provide protection for the connector interface when the two halves are not mated. The 
plastisol caps, available for plugs and receptacles, are suitable for providing temporary 
protection from dirt, dust, and paint overspray. The thermoplastic caps provide an environmental 
seal for an unmated plug.

BACKSHELLS
The DEUTSCH DT and DTM series backshells are designed to snap 
onto and mate with all standard (basic plug and receptacles without 
modifications that affect the rear of the connector) DT and DTM 
series connectors. The rigid, durable backshells offer a high level 
of protection and allow convoluted tubing to nest within the rear 
of the backshell. Straight (180°) and right angle (90°) versions and 
backshells with strain relief for jacketed cable are also available.
Since the backshells are designed to work with the standard DT 
and DTM connectors, tests should be conducted for fit and function 
of a backshell being used on any part with a modification.

approximately one inch 
behind the contact barrel.
Step 2:
Hold connector with rear 
grommet facing you.
Step 3:
Push contact straight into 
connector grommet until 
a click is felt. A slight tug 
will confirm that it is prop-
erly locked in place.
Step 4:
Once all contacts are in 
place, insert green wedge. 
The green wedge will snap 
into place.
Step 1:
Remove green wedge 
using needlenose pliers to 
pull wedge straight out.
Step 2:
To remove the contacts, 
gently pull wire back-
wards, while at the same 
time releasing the locking 
finger by moving it away 
from the contact with a 
screwdriver.
Step 3:
Hold the rear seal in place, 
as removing the contact 
will displace the seal.

DEUTSCH Common Contacts
DEUTSCH Common Contacts Overview
Several contacts are used interchangeably across most DEUTSCH connector product lines. This commonality 
improves performance, reliability, and maintainability by reducing changes in the assembly of the wire 
harness. The use of the same contact system helps eliminate many of the failures reported in harnesses 
where hundreds of different terminations are used.
CONTACT STYLES
Two styles of contacts are available: solid and stamped & formed. Both contact types use a crimp style 
termination, eliminating the need for solder. The variations in the contact system are those dictated by wire 
gauge and contact style.
Solid
The solid contacts are designed for use with larger wire size and heavy duty applications. 
Solid contacts are manufactured using a cold heading process with solid copper 
alloy wire and are available with either a nickel or gold plating finish. 
Solid contacts terminate wire from 4 AWG to 20 AWG (25 - 0.5mm2) and are available in 5 sizes each 
of the pin and socket. The applicable contact is determined by the size of the conductor only. 
Stamped & Formed
Stamped & formed contacts are designed for use where wire termination 
costs are of primary concern without sacrificing reliability of electrical 
circuits. The stamped & formed contacts are made on a precision stamping 
machine using flat strip stock, then a durable and corrosion proof nickel, tin, 
or optional gold plating is applied. 
The stamped & formed style contacts terminate wire from 10 AWG to 22 AWG 
(6.0 - 0.35mm2) and are available in multiple sizes to accommodate a wide 
range of wire insulation. The specific contact is determined by the 
outside diameter of wire insulation and conductor size.

CRIMPING CONFIGURATIONS
Stamped & formed contacts use a folded type of crimp (Fig. 
1) while solid contacts use a 1, 2, or 4 indent crimp (Fig. 2). In 
both styles of crimps, the wire strands and the contact material 
are formed together in a solid mass creating a reduction of 
the wire strand area. The reduced wire strand area creates a 
minimum of voids allowing for excellent conductivity. Crimping 
may be accomplished with hand tools or power tools.
Crimping
Crimping is defined as the act of joining a conductor to a pin or socket contact using a mechanical tool to 
compress and displace metal. In a good crimp joint, there is mutual flow of metal, causing a symmetrical 
distortion of wire strands.

is not recommended. 
BENEFITS OF CRIMPED CONTACTS
Mechanically crimping contacts is the leading wire termination 
method for some very good reasons:
• With smaller wire, the crimp is as strong as the wire itself.
• The joint can be visually inspected. Viewing the wire through 
an inspection hole in the contact makes inspection quick 
and easy, both by the operator and the inspector.
• Plating thickness is not restricted, as in solder joints, so better 
corrosion resistance and contact reliability are achieved.
• Crimping can be done anywhere, without special preparation. 
Terminations are replaced or modified in the field exactly the same 
as in the shop, using the same tools and the same techniques, 
and with the same ease of operation and certainty of results. 
• Total installed and maintenance costs are lower.
Solder should not be added 
to DEUTSCH terminals.
INDUSTRIAL & COMMERCIAL TRANSPORTATION /// TERMINALS AND CONNECTORS

CRIMP INSPECTION
Crimping tools provide lower total installation and maintenance costs. However, controls are required 
to help confirm that the proper crimp tools designed for the type and size contact are used, the pin 
or socket is properly inserted into the tool, the wire insulation is stripped properly, and the wire fully 
inserts into the contact.
When a crimp is completed, correct termination can be visually inspected. The inspector should check for:
• The removed insulation should expose a conductor length that will pass beyond 
the inspection hole in the contact and still reveal the appropriate length of 
conductor between the contact and the insulation on the wire. 
• Wire strands intact.
• All wire strands enter the contact barrel.
• Wire inserted to the proper depth in the contact.
When the correct crimp tool and process are used, a good termination results.

Accessories
Additional accessories are available to aid in the design flexibility and sealing requirements of applications. 
Accessory items such as sealing plugs and keying pins help to maintain an environmental seal and prevent 
mis-mating.
KEYING PINS
Keying pins are solid plastic rods used to help prevent mis-mating of like connectors in close proximity. 
Applicable DEUTSCH product lines include HD10, HD30, HDP20, DT, and DTM series.
Keying pins are inserted into the retention fingers of an empty socket cavity. Once installed, the keying pin 
blocks a mating contact pin from being inserted. The contact pin will be blocked before the coupling device 
mates the connectors, helping to prevent the mis-mating of like connectors. Proper usage requires that the 
corresponding mating pin be omitted and a sealing plug inserted in the rear cavity of the mating connector. 
Individual applications will vary, and testing should be done to determine the best pattern arrangement to 
help prevent improper connector mating.
Note
Multiple keying pins may 
be required to help prevent 
unintentional forced mating. 
Note
TXL wire insulation with 10 AWG 
is not recommended because it 
may not provide an environmental 
seal against the insert seal.
CONTACT CRIMP SLEEVE REDUCER
A crimp sleeve reducer is available to allow DEUTSCH size 4 solid contacts to accept 8-10 AWG wire. When
populating a connector using a contact with a reducer sleeve, be sure the insert seal penetrates the rear 
grommet. The use of the crimp sleeve reducer requires no extra crimp tools and provides an easy transition 
and increased flexibility.

Crimp Tool Overview
The two types of DEUTSCH contacts are solid and stamped & formed. Both styles of contacts 
are designed for crimp style terminations - no solder is required or recommended. A crimp style 
termination displaces the wire strands creating a superior bond between the wire and the contact.  
Several tools are available for hand and production wire crimping, wire insertion and removal, and 
wedgelock/terminal position assurance removal. The tools are specific to the solid contacts or the 
stamped & formed contacts. To create a proper crimp and achieve the highest performance 
specifications, contacts must be crimped with the recommended tooling. 
Automated Tooling Overview
For higher production volumes, a pneumatic power crimp tool is available for the DEUTSCH solid 
contacts, and applicator dies for stamped & formed contacts. The HDP-400, a pneumatic solid crimp 
tool, is a fast, bench-top tool that crimps most DEUTSCH contacts. The HDP-400 has a foot control, 
and easy-to-change dies and locators for each contact size. TE’s stamped & formed OCEAN applicator 
dies are heavy duty mini-dies that work in many industry standard presses. The OCEAN applicator 
dies offer simple adjustments and the flexibility to accept different sized contacts and wire gauge.

Hand Tool Overview
For field service, prototype, and low-volume production, there are several easy-to-use hand crimp tools for both 
solid barrel and stamped & formed contacts. All hand crimp tools provide a tight, complete crimp with minimal 
effort. The HDT-48-00, the most commonly used tool for solid contacts, crimps a wide range of contact sizes. 
It provides a symmetrical four indent crimp, is compact and easy-to-use for field service, yet sturdy and reliable 
enough for low volume production. Hand crimp tools for DEUTSCH stamped & formed contacts are wire gauge 
specific and simultaneously crimp the insulation and conductor, saving time and effort during field service.

WIRE STRIPPING
CRIMPING WITH THE HDT-48-00 HAND TOOL
How To Instructions
Step 3:
Measure the exposed 
strands to be sure the 
crimp length is correct. 
Step 1:
1. Choose the correct 
AWG for the contact 
being used.    
2. Measure from the end 
of the wire the recom-
mended strip length 
according to the contact 
size.
3. Place the wire into a 
stripping tool at the rec-
ommended strip length. 
Strip the wire according 
to stripping tool instruc-
tions.
Step 2:
1. After stripping, a small 
piece of the insulation 
should come off.
2. Check for any broken 
strands or for a dent in 
the wire. If either exist, 
the wire is damaged 
and should be cut and 
stripped again.
Leaving the stripped portion of the 
insulation on the wire until crimping 
will avoid flayed wire strands.
Incorrect
Step 3:
1. Insert wire into contact.

Bussed Overview
DEUTSCH industrial bussed feedback receptacles are environmentally sealed connectors designed for use 
in heavy duty applications where multiple circuits require a common electrical pathway. Available in the 
DT Series, DEUTSCH bussed connectors feature integrated bussbars with standard DEUTSCH contacts.
A bussbar, or buss, is a thin conductive strip connecting two or more contacts within the body of a connector. 
Bussbars allow power or data to be fed into a connector through one or more terminals and drawn out as 
needed through the other contacts on the same buss. Connectors can carry one or more bussbars, creating 
multiple independent electrical circuits within the same connector body and distributing power or data to 
many components. A single bussed connector can replace several standard connectors or splices, saving space, 
wiring, and weight.
DT SERIES BUSSED FEEDBACK RECEPTACLES
DT bussed feedback receptacles are a compact economical bussing
option housed in rugged, field-proven DT receptacle bodies. The bussed 
DTs mate with standard DT plugs and meet all the performance 
specifications for the DT series. The connectors are available in multiple 
buss configurations using standard size 16 contacts, with plating options 
in nickel or gold.
BUSSED EXAMPLES
In the examples, there are three size 16 pins each rated for 13 amps 
mounted to the buss. A total of 13 amps can be pulled into one pin and 
going out the 13 amps are split between the remaining two pins. No more 
than 13 amps can go through any single pin.

Note
The maximum current rating is the 
total amount of current for the entire 
buss. Current can be distributed 
in many combinations, but cannot 
exceed 13 amps per contact.

CAN Overview
Controller Area Networks, or CAN, are multiplex data systems. Multiplexing allows multiple data signals to 
travel on the same wires, integrating separate electronic systems and applications to a single point control and 
monitoring system. Using signals sent over a serial network, CAN systems provide instantaneous monitoring 
of diagnostic and control systems allowing early detection of potential problems. Early detection of problems  
leads to lower repair costs and reduced downtime. CAN systems allow an operator to use a single command 
station to control diagnostic systems and receive such varied information as brake and transmission 
temperature, tire pressure, fuel efficiency, and emissions levels. Anything that can be measured and controlled 
electronically can be monitored and directed by a CAN system.

ISO/CD 11783-2 ISO BOX AND ASSOCIATED CONNECTORS
Originally designed for agricultural applications, the DEUTSCH ISO 
Box creates a communication pathway between an on-board CAN 
system and the electronic components on an attached implement. 
The HDBox, which holds two DT13 connectors and an HD30 series 
receptacle, mounts on the vehicle and mates with an HD30 plug 
connector that features a breakaway coupling ring. DEUTSCH 
breakaway couplings are designed to help prevent damage to the 
vehicle or the attached implement by fragmenting and separating 
from the vehicle in the event of a drive-away disconnect.

Controller Area Networks
CAN PRODUCT OPTIONS
Whether you’re building a Controller Area Network for anything from on/ 
off-highway, construction, material handling, agriculture machines, to 
your OEM fleet of fire engines, there is a DEUTSCH solution for your CAN 
needs. Options include several configurations: 2-wire, 3-wire, and 4-wire, 
with in-line and flange mount, along with splitters, heavy duty breakaway 
connectors, and an off-board 9-pin diagnostic connector. 
SAE J1939 is a specific type of CAN that defines the communications 
pathways for vehicle networks. Improved electrical systems as defined 
under SAE J1939 allow electrical devices to communicate with each 
other. Communication occurs using a Controlled Area Network between 
intelligent sensors over a serial network. Through a series of microprocessors 
a CAN interconnects every device establishing a common link between each.
There are three main electrical interconnect subsets of J1939 including /11, /13, and /15:
 
• J1939/11 is a 3-wire system that uses the DEUTSCH DT series connectors primarily for truck and bus. The DT 
 series accepts size 16 contacts and 14-20 AWG. Connector options include in-line, bulkhead, “Y” splitter, and 
 terminating resistors. 
 
• J1939/13 is a system that uses the DEUTSCH HD10 series connectors for on-board diagnostics. The HD10 
 series accepts size 16 contacts and 14-20 AWG. 
 
• J1939/15 is a 2-wire system that uses the DEUTSCH DTM series connectors. The DTM series accepts size  
 20 contacts and 16-22 AWG. Connector options include in-line, “Y” splitter, and terminating resistors.
The sophistication of equipment design is demanding increased response of electrical systems. The application 
of J1939 allows designers to improve the quantity and the quality of the options offered along with increased 
electrical system reliability.

Diodes & Resistors Overview
DEUTSCH DT connectors with diodes and resistors are useful anywhere you need to regulate power or protect 
a device against a potential power surge. 
A diode allows current to flow in one direction only. By preventing current from traveling a circuit in the wrong 
direction, a diode can protect an electronic device from damage. Devices with batteries will often use diodes to 
prevent power from flowing in reverse if the battery is not installed correctly.
A resistor limits or blocks current flow in both directions. Resistors protect sensitive electronics by limiting the 
amount of electricity that can flow to the device through the resistor, and therefore preventing power spikes. 
For example, resistors are used to prevent power surges from burning out an LED by restricting current flow to 
the light.
DEUTSCH diode and resistor connectors are easily added to an application after the fact if unwanted power 
surges are discovered.

Printed Circuit Board Connectors
Printed Circuit Board Overview
Printed circuit board or PCB connectors are heavy duty environmentally 
sealed connectors designed for wire-to-circuit board connections. 
TE Connectivity Industrial & Commercial Transportation’s connectors 
are built to maintain the integrity and continuity of data and power 
signals in harsh environments. Developed and designed for heavy 
duty electronically equipped vehicles, TE’s printed circuit board 
connector bodies will withstand dust, dirt, moisture, and vibration.
Available in a variety of styles from several different connector 
families, TE’s printed circuit board connectors cover a range of pin 
counts from 2 to 76 and wire gauges from 10 to 22. Many of the 
connectors are available in straight, 90°, or solder pot options.
Note
See individual product 
line sections for part 
numbering system.

Single Terminal Overview
Two different solutions are available for applications that require heavy duty single terminal connections. 
DEUTSCH DTHD series connectors and Jiffy Splices provide environmentally sealed field-serviceable 
connections for the full range of wire gauges covered by DEUTSCH contacts. DTHD connectors are heavy 
duty power terminations for in-line and mounted applications. Jiffy Splices are lightweight in-line splices for 
quick connections. Both options provide easy installation and service with standard tools and contacts.
DTHD SERIES OVERVIEW
DTHD connectors are single terminal connectors for heavy duty 
applications. Easy to install, environmentally sealed and compact in 
size, they are a simple, field serviceable alternative to a splice. DTHD 
connectors are available in three sizes, carry 25 to 100 amps, and can 
be mounted or used in-line.

Requirements & Standards
IMDS
The International Material Data System (IMDS) is a 
collective, computer-based material data system 
developed as a collaborative effort by large automo-
tive OEMs to manage environmentally relevant as-
pects of parts used in vehicles. It has been adopted 
as the global standard for reporting material content 
in the automotive industry. TE Connectivity recogniz-
es IMDS and will work with customers that use the 
system.
IP Rating
The IP Rating system is a way of classifying the de-
gree of protection provided against the intrusion of 
solid objects, dust, and water in electrical enclosures. 
The 6 in IP 67 means that the connectors have to be 
completely sealed from fine dust. The 7 in IP 67 
means that the connector needs to be protected 
from the effects of a one meter submersion. 
AMPSEAL, AMPSEAL 16, HDSCS, and LEAVYSEAL 
connectors are IP 67 rated. DEUTSCH connectors 
are rated IP 68. The 8 in IP 68 means that the con-
nector needs to be protected from the effects of 
immersion in water under pressure for long periods.
IP6K9K
IP6K9K is similar to the standard IP Ratings, but 
is commonly referred to as a pressure washing 
specification. The letter K is used after the numbers 
to denote special testing. The 6K means the connec-
tors need to be completely sealed from fine dust. 
The 9K means the connector needs to be protect-
ed from the penetrating effects of water used for 
high pressure/steam jet cleaning purposes. Several 
DEUTSCH connectors in the DT, DTM, DRC, and DRB 
series have been through independent lab testing 
and pass IP6K9K, as well as AMPSEAL connectors. 
HDSCS and LEAVYSEAL connectors used with the 
appropriate accessories meet the IP6K9K standard. 
J1939/11, J1939/13, and J1939/15
See CAN section.
J2030
J2030 is an SAE standard for connectors between 
two cables or between a cable and an electrical 
component. The standard primarily focuses on 
the connectors used to mate to the electrical 
component. J2030 also provides environmental 
test and acceptance criteria for connectors 
used in DC electrical systems of 50 V or less in 
heavy duty applications typically used in off-
highway equipment. Severe applications may 
require more rigid test levels, or field-testing 
on the intended application. AMPSEAL 16 
connectors meet the SAE J2030 standard.
RoHS
The Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) 
in electrical and electronic equipment is a Eu-
ropean directive. The directive restricts the use 
of lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromi-
um, polybrominated biphenyls, and polybro-
minated diphenyl ether in new electrical and 
electronic components. To verify individual 
product compliance, please visit http://www.
te.com/commerce/alt/product-compliance.do.
UL Recognized
A UL Recognized Component is one that is 
to be installed within a larger assembly by a 
manufacturer, and this larger assembly is then 
expected to be tested by UL to become UL 
LISTED. AMPSEAL, AMPSEAL 16, and many 
DEUTSCH connectors are UL Recognized 
Components. DEUTSCH connectors that are UL 
Recognized Components include the AEC, DRC, 
DT, DTM, DTP, HD10, and HDP20 series. Not every 
variation and/or modification within a DEUTSCH 
series may be UL Recognized Components. 
AMPSEAL connectors are UL 94 V0 rated. 
LEAVYSEAL and HDSCS products constructed 
with a UL 94 V0 rated material are available.

ring. Along with a lockwasher, a panel nut is used for 
mounting.
Partial Strip: A quantity less than a standard full reel 
of stamped & formed contacts.
PCB (Printed Circuit Board) Mount: Connectors de-
signed for wire to printed circuit board applications.

Glossary
Peak Voltage: The maximum instantaneous voltage.
Pin Housing (Cap): One half of a mated pair of con-
nectors. AMPSEAL 16 pin housings mate with a recep-
tacle contact housing (plug) and house pin contacts.
Plating: Thin overlay coating of metal on contacts or 
components. Can be used to improve conductivity, 
provide for easy soldering, and prevent corrosion.
Plug: One half of a mated pair of connectors. Plugs 
typically have the locking mechanism for the mat-
ed pair, usually house the sockets, and mate with a 
receptacle.
Pre-Tinned: Solder applied to the contact and/or con-
ductor prior to soldering.
Primary Latch Reinforcement (PLR): Locking mech-
anism that snaps into place on the mating face of a 
connector after the connector is populated. A PLR 
holds contacts in correct alignment for mating and 
prevents them from being removed.
Pull-Out Force: Measured energy required to separate 
a conductor from a contact, or a contact from a termi-
nation assembly.
Ratchet Control: A crimping device that helps provide 
a full crimping cycle by allowing motion in only one 
direction until contact is fully crimped.
Receptacle: One half of a mated pair of connectors. 
Receptacles mate with a plug and usually house pins.
Receptacle Housing (Plug): One half of a mated pair 
of connectors. AMPSEAL and AMPSEAL 16 plugs typ-
ically have the locking mechanism for the mated pair, 
house the receptacle contacts, and mate with a pin 
housing (cap) or header.
Reduced Diameter Seal: Smaller than standard holes 
in the connector grommet. 
Removal Tool: Device to disengage contacts from 
connector body.
Retaining Bolt: Screw used to draw and hold mating 
connectors together.
Retaining Sleeve: Lining sheath that fits into recepta-
cle body to maintain internal seal and provide keying.
Reverse Arrangement: Non-standard cavity/contact 
assignment (eg. Plug connectors that require pin con-
tacts, and receptacles that require socket contacts). 
Ring Adapter (HDP20): Cylindrical rim or collar at-
tached to the rear of a connector to allow the attach-
ment of backshells or strain relief. 
Sealed Flange: A flange that is molded or tooled as 
an integral part of the connector body to help prevent 
leakage at the mounting site.
Sealing Plug: A non-conductive dummy pin inserted 
to fill an open cavity in a connector. Sealing plugs are 
required to maintain the integrity of the environmen-
tal seal.
Seamless Terminal or Splice: Terminal or splice 
conductor barrel made from a single piece of metal, 
finished without lines or grooves that would typically 
appear where metal is joined to metal.
Secondary Lock: Device inserted into or onto the 
connector interface to position and hold contacts in 
correct alignment. Secondary locks are called wedge-
locks or terminal position assurance.
Self-Extinguishing: The characteristic of a material 
whose flame is extinguished after the igniting flame is 
removed.
Selective Plating: Application of a thin coating of a 
finish metal to specific parts of a contact, but not to 
others. If selective plating is used, plating is typically 
applied to the mating surface to provide better con-
ductivity and reduce wear and corrosion.
Shells: Outside case into which the insert and con-
tacts are assembled. Shells of mating connectors usu-
ally also provide proper alignment and protection of 
projecting contacts. Also known as housing or body.

Glossary
Shield: A metallic layer, commonly aluminum or cop-
per, of tape, braid or spiral wrapped wire construction. 
Its primary purpose is to prevent electrostatic or elec-
tromagnetic interference between adjacent wires and 
external sources.
Shielded Cable: A cable in which the insulated con-
ductor or conductors is/are enclosed in a conducting 
envelope or envelopes. Constructed so that essen-
tially every point on the surface of the insulation is at 
ground potential or at some predetermined potential 
with respect to ground.
Shrink Boot Adapter: Thermoplastic rear adapter de-
signed to provide a lip for heat shrink to form around 
to attach it securely to a connector. 
Signal: An electric current used to convey information 
either digital, analog, audio or video.
Sleeving: A braided, knitted or woven tube.
Splice: A connection of two or more conductors or 
cables to provide good mechanical strength as well as 
good conductivity.
Socket Contact Sleeve: A cylindrical, protective en-
casement for the contact fingers or a contact spring. 
The socket contact sleeve holds the inner mechanism 
of the contact in place and provides a smooth exterior 
surface.
Solderless Connection: Joint between two metals 
created by pressure without the use of metallic alloy 
compounds or heat.
Solid Contact: Closed barrel terminal manufactured 
using a cold heading process.
Stamped & Formed Contact: Open barrel terminal 
manufactured using a precision stamping process. 
Strain Relief: Hard plastic or metal device that attach-
es to the rear of a connector to provide wire support.
Strand: A single filament of uninsulated wire.
Strip: To remove insulation from a conductor.
Swedge: A cold-forging process to press-fit or force 
two metal forms into one. 
“T” Seal: Reduced diameter insert cavity in the rear 
grommet. Also referred to as thin seal, a “T” seal 
allows for the use of smaller wire or thinner insula-
tion diameter. A “T” seal is larger than an “E” seal and 
smaller than an “N” seal.
Temperature Coefficient of Resistivity: The change in 
resistance per degree of change in temperature.
Terminal: A device designed to attach to the end of a 
conductor wire to allow it to connect to another con-
ductor wire and allow electrical current to pass be-
tween them. Also commonly referred to as a contact. 
UL Recognized Component: One that is to be  
installed within a larger assembly by a manufacturer, 
and this larger assembly is then expected to be tested 
by UL to become UL Listed.
