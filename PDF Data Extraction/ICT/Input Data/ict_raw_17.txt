AMPSEAL Connectors
AMPSEAL Connector Overview
AMPSEAL connectors provide rugged reliability and environmental 
sealing. They are available in cable plugs and PCB mount headers that 
are designed to stand up to high-temperature underhood applications.
The pre-assembled receptacle housing connector features built-in contact 
sealing and an integral interfacial seal that protects mated connectors.
